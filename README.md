# LGMVIP-Web-Task-Number-1
The repository of Lets Grow More Web Development internship Task Number 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a simple todo list website.
the website is created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only.
In this to do list there is one button which trigger written text to add on the page so that user can see all his tasks.
Also a user can delete and Mark as complete the tasks.

It has a very great feature like storage.
By using the java script the code is implemented to store all the task you add and remove the task when you delete the tasks from the page.
It also stores the completed task that a user marked.
I seperated the all the files like index file is of HTML and Style file has pure CSS only and Script file has all the methods and algorithms written in JavaScript to make the function works to Run this ToDo List.
So after adding task if user refresh the browser the task will not be deleted automatically.

But this Todo list has some problems and Downside also-
1. It is responsive only for the screen width is greater than 600px. It gives output as same as written in program and required for tablet and Laptops. For phones or smaller display devices it works very well but buttons get disturbed from its position means it not responsive for smaller size devices.
2. You can not delete all the tasks in oneclick. This can be implemented later if required.
3. User can not sort the task by any of the filters. A filter function can be created and add on Script.js later on if required.
4. It does't store the timing and dates when the task is created.

But it has lot of the potential to make your Skills better at web development and make your CV little stronger.

Hope You Find This Helpful.

Thanks.
